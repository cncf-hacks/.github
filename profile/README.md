# CloudNativeHacks

Set to run alongside KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2024, CNCF is excited to offer the first-ever hackathon, CloudNativeHacks, with challenges provided by the United Nations.

This inaugural hackathon will focus exclusively on advancing the delivery of the UN SDGs. Participants will create AI or web applications to help support the 17 SDGs as these challenges can only be solved by a global partnership.
